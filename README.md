This repository holds components and utilitiles for use in blazor projects.

##FileUpload
This component seeks to fix a fundamental flaw in the file upload provided by base Blzor - namily the inability to upload files in multiple batches. The built-in file upload component only allows uploading the most recent batch of files to be added by the user.

This component also has basic validation and file management (delete and rename).
