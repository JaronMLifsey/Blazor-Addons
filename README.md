# Blazor Addons
This repository holds components and utilities for use in Blazor projects.

## Components

### FileUpload
This component seeks to fix a fundamental flaw in the file upload provided by base Blazor - namely the inability to upload files in multiple batches. The built-in file upload component only allows uploading the most recent batch of files to be added by the user.

This component also has basic validation and file management (delete and rename).
